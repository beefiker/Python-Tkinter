Standing on cliff Mr Lonely diver
I'm waiting your sign
I'm ready to jump off
Why even this?moment?feel
So lonely and?sorrow
I'm looking for some reason
Why I?stop to dive
Standing on cliff Mr Lonely diver
Im waiting your sign I'm ready to jump off
Nobody could relate to my mind
Or everybody could relate to my mind
Imma dive
Feel alive
In the perfect night
Yeah this perfect night
Can't wake up from this vibe
Feel like I might can fly
No lean no molly cocaine
I can't stop this fxxking light
I'm surfing starry night
Under my feet it's too dark
Yesterday it was blue lake
But now it looks like a dark space
Im on the diving spot
But why I'm still so lonely
Everything look so small
Why did they look so huge for me
Fxxk off I gotta dive
It's different with suicide
Oh I'm fxxkin lonely little diver
Standing on cliff Mr Lonely diver
I'm waiting your sign I'm ready to jump off
Why even this moment
Feel so lonely and sorrow
I'm looking for some reason why I stop to dive
Standing on cliff Mr Lonely diver
Im waiting your sign I'm ready to jump off
Nobody could relate to my mind
Or everybody could relate to my mind
Imma dive
Feel alive
In the perfect night
Yeah this perfect night
Smoke with orange light
Im baking whole fxxking sound
Feel like Kanye west for now
All lyrics are improvised
I'm sick and tired of this town
Here's no any god im finding
Fake advertisement for fake blue and suicide
Im on the diving spot
But why I'm still so lonely
Everything look so small
Why did they look so huge for me
Fxxk off I gotta dive
It's different with suicide
Oh I'm fxxkin lonely little diver
Standing on cliff Mr Lonely diver
I'm waiting your sign I'm ready to jump off
Why even this moment
Feel so lonely and sorrow
I'm looking for some reason why I stop to dive
Standing on cliff Mr Lonely diver
Im waiting your sign I'm ready to jump off
Nobody could relate to my mind
Or everybody could relate to my mind
Imma dive
Feel alive
In the perfect night
Yeah this perfect night
Going thru drive thru
I'm on my a way uh huh
Just picked your burgers
You don't need to come
I just climb down mountain
There's nothing in my fountain
Same night but it's different
Same night but it's deeper
